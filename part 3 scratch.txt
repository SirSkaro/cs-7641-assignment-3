Letter
- In general, EM has better ground-truth evaluation than KMC
- None of the reduction helped improve the V-Score above the vanilla EM V-Score

Letter KMC
- For PCA, KPCA and ICA, maximum Silho score looks to be at a smaller cluster size. Need to explore

Letter EM
- Monotonic decrease in V-Score after ~225 for vanilla and all transformations. True for BIC. Should explore that area
- KPCA significantly had better BIC scores
- ICA had best V-Measure



Scribe
- Vinilla EM did the best out of all in terms of V-Score

Scribe KMC
- Venilla and KPCA have much better homogeniety
- All v-Scores are comparably the same
- KPCA has bad silhouette scores
- KPCA doesn't think 2 clusters is a near perfect socre, which is unique
- ICA has best average silhouette scores



Scribe EM
- KPCA has best BIC score (worse V-Score than vanilla) Need to explore.
- ICA has second best BIC score with only 1 feature, but worst V-Score. Need explore
